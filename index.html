            <p>Since i was small i liked to take parts from toys and 
               make new ones out of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the age of 8 I started to study electrical engineering with a teacher
              and I made toys and cars, until one day my teacher introduced me
              micro:bit and started programming and building robots. my first
              the robot was just a programmable machine that could move in a pre-programmed way
              path around objects. 
              Then I gave it a robotic arm and added the arduino that will communicate
              with micro:bit to control the robot. Then I took out the micro:bit and
              I only used arduino, I got the diploma in 1st place in an electrical one 
              engineering competition in the country. After I left electrical engineering
              After leaving electrical engineering class at 14 I added a
              raspberry pi 4 model B to my robot and made a control web interface for
              control my robot remotely. The principle was that raspberries would be 
              sent the commands it receives from the web interface to the arduino
              through serial communication, we also added web video streaming
              interface from the robot's video camera.</p>

            <p>I started programming at the age of 10. </p>
            <p>When I started with robotics, I also started with programming as I had
              to program my robots, I made many programs for each new version of
              my robot, since then I've learned some c++ and html and I'm still learning.
              In the future, I would like to add some AI to my robot's image processing,
              maybe connect it to a big language model like chat gbt.</p>
